## Definition

Intuitively, we would say that two events $$A$$ and $$B$$ are independent if knowing that one event occurred gives us no information about the other event. We can put this into mathematical form by stating that $$\mathbf{P}(B\lvert A)=\mathbf{P}(B)$$ or $$\mathbf{P}(A\lvert B)=\mathbf{P}(A)$$. From this, we say that events $$A$$ and $$B$$ are **independent** if

$$\mathbf{P}(A\cap B)=\mathbf{P}(A)\,\mathbf{P}(B).$$

### Disjoint Events

Disjoint events are not necessarily independent. Consider the figure below.

We have $$\mathbf{P}(A)>0$$, $$\mathbf{P}(B)>0$$ and $$\mathbf{P}(A\cap B)=0$$ so that

$$\mathbf{P}(A\cap B)\neq\mathbf{P}(A)\,\mathbf{P}(B).$$

$$A$$ and $$B$$ are **not independent**.

### Independence of Complements

If $$A$$ and $$B$$ are independent, then $$A$$ and $$B^\mathsf{C}$$ are independent.
