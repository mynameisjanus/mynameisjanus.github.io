A **random variable** $$X$$ is a function or a mapping from the sample space $$\Omega$$ to the real numbers, i.e., it associates a real number to every possible outcome. Mathematically, we say that

$$X:\Omega\rightarrow\mathbb{R}.$$

There can be several random variables defined on a single sample space. Moreover, a random variable can be discrete or continuous. Consider tossing a coin 5 times. We can define a random variable as the number of heads that comes up. In this case, we have a discrete random variable. In this section, we will be dealing with discrete random variables.
