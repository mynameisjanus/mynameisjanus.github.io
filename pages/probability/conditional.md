## What is a conditional probability?

Suppose we want to know the probability of getting a prime number if we pick from 1 to 100. Since there are 25 prime numbers from 1 to 100, then this probability is $$\frac{25}{100}$$ or $$\frac{1}{4}$$. Now, suppose we are given the information that the number we pick will always be odd. Because there are 24 odd prime numbers and 50 odd numbers, then the probability becomes $$\frac{24}{50}$$ or $$\frac{12}{25}$$. The probability changed because of the new information! This is called **conditioning**.

We denote the **conditional probability** of $$A$$, given that $$B$$ occurred, by $$\mathbf{P}(A\vert B)$$ and it is defined as

$$\mathbf{P}(A|B)=\dfrac{\mathbf{P}(A\cap B)}{\mathbf{P}(B)}.$$

This definition holds only if $$\mathbf{P}(B)>0$$.
