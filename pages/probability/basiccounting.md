If you haven't downloaded [Atom](https://atom.io/), download and install it. Use this as your editor when working with Jekyll. The syntax highlighting is probably the best among the available editors, as it was designed with Jekyll-authoring in mind. However, if you prefer Sublime Text, WebStorm, or some other editor, you can also use that.

Customize the invisibles and tab spacing in Atom:

1.  Go to **Atom > Preferences**.
2.  On the **Settings** tab, keep the default options but also select the following:
    * **Show Invisibles**
    * **Soft Wrap**
    * For the **Tab Length**, type **4**.
    * For the **Tab Type**, select **soft**.

Turn off auto-complete:

1.  Go to **Atom > Preferences**.
2.  Click the **Packages** tab.
3.  Search for **autocomplete-plus**.
4.  Disable the autocomplete package.

### Atom Shortcuts

* **Cmd + T**: Find file
* **Cmd + Shift + F**: Find across project
* **Cmd + Alt + S**: Save all

(For Windows, replace "Cmd" with "Ctrl".)
